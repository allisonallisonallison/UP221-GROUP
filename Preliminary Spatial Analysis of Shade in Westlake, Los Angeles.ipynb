    "Extreme heat arrives without announcement. Over a span of a few hours in temperatures above 90° Fahrenheit, the limits of what the body can endure is manifested. The risk of cardiac arrest, kidney injury, and heat stroke start to increase, behavior begins to change, dehydration and mobility challenges reveal themselves. Heat does not discriminate but vulnerable populations, the elderly, the unhoused, low-income households without cooling units, and those reliant on public transportation face the brunt of the event. \n",

    "The Westlake neighborhood is situated by the communities of Wilshire, Silverlake-Echo Park,  Central City, and south Central Los Angeles. 20% of people living in Westlake are over the age of 65 – a group at high-risk of heat streets and heat related health attributes. The median income in Westlake is $29,613, slightly above the federal poverty line for a family of four but substantially below the City of Los Angeles’ poverty line. Our preliminary analysis of American Community Survey (ACS) data reveals that Westlake has the highest percentage of transit riders of all census tracts in Los Angeles County.\n",
